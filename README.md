## Built With

- Swift - Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.
- Alamofire - Alamofire is a Swift-based HTTP networking library for iOS and macOS
- ReachabilitySwift - Reachability.swift is a replacement for Apple's Reachability sample, re-written in Swift with closures.
- SDWebImage - This library provides an async image downloader with cache support. For convenience, we added categories for UI elements like `UIImageView`, `UIButton`, `MKAnnotationView`.
